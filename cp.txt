So until now, the developer peeps have spoken their piece.

I believe web-dev should not be the entropic end stage for anybody in B.Tech. Y'all are programmers first and foremost, always remember that. Becoming an intermediate in any field should not take up most of your time if your foundations in problem solving and critical/mathematical thinking are string.



This is why I believe you should do cp/dsa, not just helping your interviews but just the idea of spacial awareness of how things are moving in your head and the metacognition required to form lemmas in your head which solve the problem, this constant need of asking questions to the question itself and making it tick wanting to find out how its working.


Ofcourse dsa exists in a vacuum if you solo practice, cp is inherently a community based practice method. It is literally upskilling in public and

not to mention maths is beautiful sometimes.
